    <p>Tickets for the NJF 2024 are available <a href="https://tickets.stichtingnjf.nl/product-categorie/njf-2024/">here</a>! The tickets are available during different phases. The first phase runs from January 22nd until February 25th. The second phase runs from February 26th until April 21st. After April 21st, pre-registration is still possible but only for the door price. All tickets for Saturday include a Gala show ticket worth &euro;15. Be quick because this year we have a <b>limited number of camping spots</b>, so purchase your ticket swiftly and secure yourself a spot at the campsite. The earlier you buy your ticket, the more discount you get! This also gives the organization a good insight into the expected number of visitors, allowing them to shape the festival as well as possible. Note that there is no breakfast on Thursday and no dinner on Sunday, due to the start and end times of the NJF.</p>

    <h2>The Support ticket</h2>
    <p>This year, we are introducing the Support ticket, a special kind of ticket that contributes to keeping the festival accessible and affordable for everyone. Additionally, purchasing this ticket helps make the festival even more special and amazing. For instance, it could enable us to book that one awesome gala show artist. The price of the Support ticket varies depending on when you buy it. During the first phase of ticket sales, the ticket is available for &euro;135. After the first phase, the ticket is available for &euro;145. It is also possible to donate more.</p>
